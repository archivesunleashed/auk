  <h1 class=about_h1>Our Transition to Archive-It</h1>
    <p class="about_p"><em>On 30 June 2021, the Cloud will be decomissioned. A new Archive-It service will take its place.</em></p>

  <h3 class=about_h3>What does this mean?</h3>
    <p class="about_p">Supported by a new grant by <%= link_to('The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation', 'https://mellon.org/', target: '_blank') %>, Archives Unleashed is partnering with our colleagues at the <%= link_to('Internet Archive', 'https://archive.org/', target: '_blank') %>. We will be integrating the Cloud with their <%= link_to('Archive-It Service', 'https://archive-it.org/', target: '_blank') %> service in order to ensure the projectâ€™s long-term sustainability, as well as enhance usability and accessibility.</p>
    <p class="about_p">As you already had to be an Archive-It subscriber to use the Archives Unleashed Cloud, we hope this won't prove too disruptive. Similar functionality to the Cloud will be available through a new "Datasets" tab there, replacing the existing <%= link_to('Archive-It Research Services', 'https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/209671666-Introduction-to-Archive-It-Research-Services-ARS-', target: '_blank') %> offerings.</p>
    <p class="about_p">For more details, you can always subscribe to our <%= link_to('project newsletter', 'http://eepurl.com/dfpU7j', target: '_blank') %> or follow our <%= link_to('project blog', 'https://news.archivesunleashed.org', target: '_blank') %>. We're excited about this next stage!</p>

  <h3 class=about_h3>When will I be able to use the Cloud until?</h3>
    <p class="about_p"><strong>Starting May 31, 2021, users will no longer be able to run jobs on the Archives Unleashed Cloud.</strong> If there are any collections you wish to analyze using the Archives Unleashed Cloud, please be sure to do so before this date. Any jobs entering the queue before May 31st will be processed. Though, if a job is triggered from a multi-terabyte collection, we cannot guarantee its completion.</p>
    <p class="about_p">On <strong>30 June 2021</strong>, we will delete the Cloud, including all of your derivative files and user data.
  <h3 class=about_h3>What do I need to do? What will happen to my data after 30 June 2021?</h3>
    <p class="about_p">If you want to keep a copy of your derivative datasets, we encourage you to download them before the Cloud shuts down.</p>
    <p class="about_p">As our project has not routinely stored ARC or WARC files beyond the time needed to process them into derivative files, you do not need to worry about any of your data remaining.</p>
    <p class="about_p">If you are an existing user, please check your email! We are working with Archive-It to provide early access to the Archive-It Research Services Cloud. As our roll-out plans emerge, we will be in touch with more details in June/July 2021. Stay tuned.</p>

  <h3 class=about_h3>I have questions! Who can I contact?</h3>
