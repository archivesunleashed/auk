<h1>About</h1>
<p><i>Helping researchers and scholars access and analyze petabytes of historical internet content.</i></p>


<div class="h3">Project Overview</div>
  <div class="para">The Archives Unleashed Cloud, referred to as AUK, is an open source cloud-based analysis tool that helps researchers and scholars conduct web archive analysis.</div>
  <div class="para">AUK is a component of the <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed Project</a>, which aims to allow researchers, scholars, librarians and archivists the ability to access and investigate their web archival collections. As accessibility is a main priority of the project, AUK supports this goal by providing a web-based front end for users to access the <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/aut/">Archives Unleashed Toolkit</a>.</div>

<div class="h3">What is Web Archiving, what are WARCS and why should I care?</div>
  <div class="para"><b>Web archiving</b> is the process of preserving born-digital content on the World Wide Web. Thinking about how curated content is organized, there are two main components:</div>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><b>WARCs (Web ARChive)</b>: the <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:28500:ed-2:v1:en">ISO Standard (28500:2017)</a> file format that will house one or more WARC records.</li>
      <li><b>WARC record</b>: contains all of the data of a webpage and contains a record header and the record content block.</li>
    </ul>
  <div class="para">The exponential rise of digitally-born data offers a unique opportunity for scholarly inquiry. However the sheer scale of web archives can be an overwhelming process for librarians, archivists, and other curators who face several challenges when working with this material. One of the largest challenges relates to accessibility. This includes a shortage of tools or tools that are largely beyond the skill base of researchers, as well as institutions with limited resources to facilitate long-term web archiving research.</div>
  
  <div class="para">The Archives Unleashed Project was born out of the need to create accessible and user-friendly tools in order to work with web archives. As a web-based interface, AUK allows researchers an opportunity to handle and analyze web archives without having to spend time delving into the technical world.</div>

<div class="h3">How can I use AUK?</div>
  <div class="para">We are currently working to improve our documentation section, please check back shortly.</div>

<div class="h3">Who can use AUK?</div>
  <div class="para">Currently, those who maintain an <a href="https://archive-it.org"> Archive-It</a> account will be able to ingest, download, and analyze their web archives collections in AUK. The AUT team is looking at ways to expand future functionality of AUK users.</div>

<div class="h3">What can I do in AUK?</div>
  <div class="para">Our goal is to get users to a point where they can really dig down into WARC files to explore their research questions. The core features of AUK include:</div>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Ingesting Archive-It collections</strong> via <a href="https://github.com/WASAPI-Community/data-transfer-apis">WASAPI</a></li>
      <li><strong>Download collection derivatives</strong>: network files, domain lists, and full text</li>
      <li><strong>In-browser network diagram</strong> to see major nodes and connections within your collection.</li>
    </ul>
  

<div class="h3">Who Created AUK?</div>
